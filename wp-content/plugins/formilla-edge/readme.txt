[Formilla Edge](http://www.FormillaEdge.com/ "Formilla Edge") allows you to create lightbox modals, website bars, and corner widgets on your WordPress website.  We offer **FREE and Premium** packages.  Brought to you by the same team that built the popular and highly rated [Formilla Live Chat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formilla-live-chat/ "Formilla Live Chat") plugin, with over 8,000 active installs!

**Formilla Edge Features:**

* **Installs Instantly:** Get started in just a few minutes.  Sign up for a Formilla account and activate this plugin to start creating widgets right away.

* **Email Collection Widgets:** Continually grow your email list with our beautiful email collection widgets and popups.

* **Facebook and Twitter Social Media Widgets:** Increase your Facebook Likes and Twitter Followers using our social media widgets.   

* **Custom Messaging Widgets:** Create custom messaging widgets to announce a limited time offer or sale, offer a coupon code, direct users to your latest blog, communicate breaking news or a maintenance outage, or market virtually anything to your visitors! (This is currently a Premium package option)

* **Lightbox Popup (Modal) Widgets:** Use lightbox popups with any of our widget types to collect email subscribers, grow your social following, or market anything using our custom messaging widgets. They also look great on mobile devices! 

* **Top or Bottom Website Bars:** Top or bottom website bars are a great alternative to lightbox modals and allow you to display a message across the top or bottom of your website. Use them to collect emails, social followers, or create custom messaging bars to communicate anything to your visitors. 

* **Sliding Corner Widgets:** The sliding corner widget is a more subtle widget which quietly slides in to display in the bottom-left or bottom-right corner of your website. This widget display type is available with any of our email collection, social, or custom messaging widgets. 

* **Timing and Scroll-based Triggers:** Display a widget after a defined number of seconds (e.g. after 15 seconds), or to automatically popup if the visitor scrolls on your website. Also control how often to display the widget to a visitor by selecting Always, One Time, Daily, Monthly, etc.

* **Exit Detection Functionality:** Increase your email subscribers by up to 200% by enabling Exit Detection functionality to collect email subscribers before visitors leave your website. Formilla Edge will automatically detect when the visitor moves their mouse outside of the browser display area and quickly displays your lightbox modal to get their attention before they're gone! (This is currently a Premium package option)

* **Mobile Ready Widgets:** The Formilla Edge widgets are mobile ready to adapt to smartphones of any size, making it easy for your website visitors to subscribe to your email newsletter and interact with your website bars and custom messaging widgets.     

* **Custom Colors and Language Support (International):** Modify the colors and text of your email, social, and custom messaging widgets.  Customize any of the text in the language of your choice, including Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, and more! 

* **Real-time Visitor Monitoring:** View the most active visitors on your site and see how they interact with your widgets in real-time. The Live Feed will display new subscriber emails, notifications when your Facebook "Like" or Twitter "Follow" buttons are clicked, and each time your custom widgets are clicked. You'll also get access to view each visitor's page URL, the referring website, the user's country/location, whether they're new or returning, and more (This is currently a Premium Package option).

* **Advanced Page and Device Targeting Rules:** Show or hide any of your widgets with flexible rules based on whether your visitors are originating from organic Google traffic, social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter, or virtually anywhere else. Also target users based on which website or webpage they're viewing, or even whether they're using a mobile/tablet or desktop device (This is currently a Premium package option). 

* **Advanced Customization Control:** Formilla Edge widgets can be customized using our Advanced CSS option.  Using HTML and CSS, add an image such as your logo, and control the location down to the pixel as you get access to the CSS to make it look perfect!

* **Export Email Data:** Export all email submissions in CSV format to easily import the data into any system supporting CSV format. 

* **Integrate with hundreds of apps using Zapier:** Automatically post email subscribers directly to your favorite apps using Zapier. Hundreds of apps are supported, including email marketing tools, CRMs, ticket systems, and a lot more (e.g. Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Pipedrive, Infusionsoft, Zendesk, etc.). (This is currently a Premium Package option)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Formilla Edge, and how is it different from Formilla Live Chat? =
Formilla Edge is a powerful lead generation, marketing, and messaging platform developed by the Formilla team. You can configure many of our powerful widgets to grow your email list with email subscriber lightbox popups, website email and social bars (top and bottom location), and also corner widgets with on-scroll and exit detection functionality.  Get started and grow your email subscribers by over 200%, build your Facebook Likes and Twitter following, and market virtually anything to your customers.  


= How do I install Formilla Edge on my website? =
Formilla Edge works with any website platform. The fastest way to install is to use this plugin; simply activate the plugin and choose Formilla Edge from the WordPress admin menu.  You'll see a link to **Sign Up** for a Formilla account and use the Plugin ID you receive to activate the plugin. You can alternatively copy and paste your unique Formilla code snippet to your webpage(s) instead. To get the code snippet, login to your Formilla.com account > **Click Widgets** in the menu > **Click the pencil icon** to view/edit any of your Edge widgets. On the following page, you can click **View Code** in the top-right area of the page and you'll see simple instructions to copy/paste the code into each of your pages. Note: you only need to install this once to power all of your widgets. 


= Does Formilla Edge work with WooCommerce websites? =
Yes, this plugin easily installs with WooCommerce sites.  Install and activate the plugin from within your WordPress/WooCommerce admin panel and start configuring email modals or widgets, Facebook and Twitter website bars, and even on-scroll corner widgets with custom messaging.  


= I'm an existing Formilla Live Chat customer; do I need to install anything to begin using Formilla Edge? =
No, we made it simple for existing live chat customers as Formilla Edge is now available to all Formilla customers! If you are currently using our live chat script or plugin, no need to add any additional plugin or code. Simply login to your Formilla account and navigate to **Widgets** in the menu, then click the **Add Edge Widget** button to configure your first Edge widget.  


= Can I receive an email notification when a visitor subscribes by submitting their email address? =
Yes, you can configure Notification Emails from the Advanced Options tab of the widget settings area. **Choose Widgets** in the Formilla menu, then **click the pencil/edit icon** for your widget to edit its settings. Select the **Advanced Options** tab and enter an email address in the **Notification Emails** box. You may add additional email recipients by simply comma-separating each email address. 


= My widget only displayed once when testing, although it will not appear again. What can I do to continue testing? =
The default setting for Formilla Edge widgets is to display **Once per Visit** and in 15 seconds. With this configuration, the widget will not display again until you close your entire browser (all tabs) and revisit your website. If you have already submitted an email address (e.g. using the email widget modal or email website bar for example), clicked to Like or Follow on Facebook/Twitter, or clicked the call-to-action button on a custom messaging widget, it will not display for your browser as you have now interacted with the widget. In this case, you can test with a different browser, or modify the settings from the **Behaviors** tab to display the widget more frequently. For instance, we recommend setting the widget to display Always and to set the "Display if user has already interacted with it?" option to Yes. This way, you'll continuously see the widget while you're testing.   


= How do I export email addresses collected with Formilla Edge email widgets? = 
You can view or export your collected emails by mousing over **Reports** in the Formilla menu and selecting the **Edge Views & Conversions** report. Make your selections on the next page using the Widget and Date filters and click Search. Subscribers collected using Formilla Edge email widgets will be displayed underneath the visual report and can be exported by clicking **Export to Excel** on the same page. 

= Can I integrate email addresses collected with my Edge widgets automatically with Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or any other platform? =
Yes, we highly recommend connecting with Zapier to automatically post leads and email addresses collected to MailChimp, Constant Contact, AWeber, and other platforms to grow your email marketing funnel.  To add Zapier integration to your Formilla account, **click the avatar dropdown** in the top-right corner of your Formilla account and choose **My Apps**. Then choose **Add App** for the Zapier app and follow the prompts to complete the setup.  Zapier also connects with over 500+ apps, including CRMs, and helpdesk ticket systems (Zapier comes with the Premium option). 


= Does Formilla offer mobile apps and how can I install them on my iPhone, iPad, or Android device? =
Our mobile apps currently support our live chat software only. To view any collected email addresses or Formilla Edge analytics reports, please login to your Formilla account from a web browser. To download our mobile apps for live chat, you can do so from the Apple App store for iPhone and iPad devices, or the Google Play store if you're using an Android smartphone or tablet. You can also search "formilla" or "formilla live chat" to find and install the app for your particular device (Premium option). 


= What is the 100 submissions/clicks limitation on the Standard (free) package? =
This is the total number of email submissions and clicks (applies to Facebook and Twitter) you can have each month with the Standard (free) package of Formilla Edge.  Each Facebook "Like" or Twitter "Follow" button click counts towards the 100 total allowed for your account per month.  At the beginning of each month, Formilla will reset the counters to 0 again.  There is no limit to the number of times your widgets are displayed, regardless of which package you're using.  Consider upgrading to the Premium package for unlimited submissions/clicks.
